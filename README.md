# Namelist-Parser
A parser for WRF namelist files.

This uses my Structures library, available at [https://github.com/Toberumono/Structures](https://github.com/Toberumono/Structures).

This is used in my WRF Runner script, available at [https://github.com/Toberumono/WRF-Runner](https://github.com/Toberumono/WRF-Runner).

That's about it.
